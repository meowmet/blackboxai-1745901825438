## üõ† Usage

### Netcat Integration

Netcat is a versatile networking tool used for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. In this project, Netcat is integrated for educational purposes to demonstrate network communication. ([NetCat-Hello-world/README.md at master - GitHub](https://github.com/ReeganArockiasmy/NetCat-Hello-world/blob/master/README.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Example: Setting Up a Listener**


```bash
nc -l -p 4444
```


**Example: Connecting to a Listener**


```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 4444
```


These commands can be used to simulate network connections and understand data flow between systems. ([How to Use Netcat Commands: Examples and Cheat Sheets - Varonis](https://www.varonis.com/blog/netcat-commands?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
